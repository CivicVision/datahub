SpenDB is a tool for understanding government financial information. Our goal is to find
new ways for those interested - journalists, policy analysts, parliamentarians or even
the mythical armchair auditor - to access, interpret and share data about the public purse.

### Is this just about budget visualization? 

While the most commonly looked-at piece of government financial data is probably budgets,
there's no need to remain limited to that source.

Information about government purchases of goods and services, funding for research, subsidies
or even payments received for resource concessions are all pieces of information that should
be accessible to the broadest possible public.

### What can I do with SpenDB?

On SpenDB, anyone can easily upload information about the way in which their government
manages its finances - whether revenue or expenditure, a budget document or a list of
individual payments for services.

Our tool provides a basic set of analytical utilities - just enough to answer some interesting
questions about policy, procurement outcomes or trendsover time. But it also provides a rich
data API, which can be used by web developers and data visualizers to build more specific,
interactive, analytical tools for a given type of data.

SpenDB is an open source project, it's [easy to set up and contribute features
