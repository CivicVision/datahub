title: Terms of Service
hidden: false


SpenDB is generously hosted by [Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V.](http://okfn.de/)
(OKF-DE), the German chapter of the global Open Knowledge community. It is therefore subject to the
[terms of service](http://okfn.de/impressum/) that cover all services operated by OKF-DE, including
the Impressum and data protection rules as mandated by German law.

### Community project notice

Please further be aware that this is a community-run effort without dedicated funding and staff. As
such, all hosting and API services provided by this platform are based on a best effort principle: we
will keep it running as long as there is a relevant level of interest, but reserve the right
to cease operating the service at any time. In such an event, we will make sure that comprehensive 
data exports will be made available, so that anyone can continue to operate their own instances of
the service.

Consider this note a call to action: open services are kept alive by the community that operates
them. If you can, and you're interested - then [join that community](contact.html) and help to make
sure this is a sustainable project!
